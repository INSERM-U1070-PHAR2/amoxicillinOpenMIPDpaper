  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the
               population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amoxicillin
               and clavulanic acid in critically ill patients. METHODS: In this
               observational pharmacokinetic study, multiple blood samples were
               taken over one dosing interval of intravenous
               amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1000/200 mg). Blood samples were
               analysed using a validated ultra HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry
               technique. Population pharmacokinetic analysis and dosing
               simulations were performed using non-linear mixed-effects
               modelling. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-four blood samples were
               collected from 13 patients. For both amoxicillin and clavulanic
               acid, a two-compartment model with between-subject variability
               for both the clearance and the volume of distribution of the
               central compartment described the data adequately. For both
               compounds, 24 h urinary creatinine clearance was supported as a
               descriptor of drug clearance. The mean clearance of amoxicillin
               was 10.0 L/h and the mean volume of distribution was 27.4 L. For
               clavulanic acid, the mean clearance was 6.8 L/h and the mean
               volume of distribution was 19.2 L. Dosing simulations for
               amoxicillin supported the use of standard dosing regimens (30
               min infusion of 1 g four-times daily or 2 g three-times daily)
               for most patients when using a target MIC of 8 mg/L and a
               pharmacodynamic target of 50\% fT>MIC, except for those with a
               creatinine clearance >190 mL/min. Dosing simulations for
               clavulanic acid showed little accumulation when high doses were
               administered to patients with high creatinine clearance.
               CONCLUSIONS: Although vast pharmacokinetic variability exists
               for both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in intensive care unit
               patients, current dosing regiments are appropriate for most
               patients, except those with very high creatinine clearance.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: To compare the performance of the standard lag time
               model (LAG model) with the performance of an analytical solution
               of the transit compartment model (TRANSIT model) in the
               evaluation of four pharmacokinetic studies with four different
               compounds. METHODS: The population pharmacokinetic analyses were
               performed using NONMEM on concentration-time data of
               glibenclamide, furosemide, amiloride, and moxonidine. In the
               TRANSIT model, the optimal number of transit compartments was
               estimated from the data. This was based on an analytical
               solution for the change in drug concentration arising from a
               series of transit compartments with the same first-order
               transfer rate between each compartment. Goodness-of-fit was
               assessed by the decrease in objective function value (OFV) and
               by inspection of diagnostic graphs. RESULTS: With the TRANSIT
               model, the OFV was significantly lower and the goodness-of-fit
               was markedly improved in the absorption phase compared with the
               LAG model for all drugs. The parameter estimates related to the
               absorption differed between the two models while the estimates
               of the pharmacokinetic disposition parameters were similar.
               CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the TRANSIT model is an
               attractive alternative for modeling drug absorption delay,
               especially when a LAG model poorly describes the drug absorption
               phase or is numerically unstable.",
