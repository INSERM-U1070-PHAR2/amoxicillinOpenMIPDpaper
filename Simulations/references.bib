               population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amoxicillin
               and clavulanic acid in critically ill patients. METHODS: In this
               observational pharmacokinetic study, multiple blood samples were
               taken over one dosing interval of intravenous
               amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1000/200 mg). Blood samples were
               analysed using a validated ultra HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry
               technique. Population pharmacokinetic analysis and dosing
               simulations were performed using non-linear mixed-effects
               modelling. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-four blood samples were
               collected from 13 patients. For both amoxicillin and clavulanic
               acid, a two-compartment model with between-subject variability
               for both the clearance and the volume of distribution of the
               central compartment described the data adequately. For both
               compounds, 24 h urinary creatinine clearance was supported as a
               descriptor of drug clearance. The mean clearance of amoxicillin
               was 10.0 L/h and the mean volume of distribution was 27.4 L. For
               clavulanic acid, the mean clearance was 6.8 L/h and the mean
               volume of distribution was 19.2 L. Dosing simulations for
               amoxicillin supported the use of standard dosing regimens (30
               min infusion of 1 g four-times daily or 2 g three-times daily)
               for most patients when using a target MIC of 8 mg/L and a
               pharmacodynamic target of 50\% fT>MIC, except for those with a
               creatinine clearance >190 mL/min. Dosing simulations for
               clavulanic acid showed little accumulation when high doses were
               administered to patients with high creatinine clearance.
               CONCLUSIONS: Although vast pharmacokinetic variability exists
               for both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in intensive care unit
               patients, current dosing regiments are appropriate for most
               patients, except those with very high creatinine clearance.",

               model (LAG model) with the performance of an analytical solution
               of the transit compartment model (TRANSIT model) in the
               evaluation of four pharmacokinetic studies with four different
               compounds. METHODS: The population pharmacokinetic analyses were
               performed using NONMEM on concentration-time data of
               glibenclamide, furosemide, amiloride, and moxonidine. In the
               TRANSIT model, the optimal number of transit compartments was
               estimated from the data. This was based on an analytical
               solution for the change in drug concentration arising from a
               series of transit compartments with the same first-order
               transfer rate between each compartment. Goodness-of-fit was
               assessed by the decrease in objective function value (OFV) and
               by inspection of diagnostic graphs. RESULTS: With the TRANSIT
               model, the OFV was significantly lower and the goodness-of-fit
               was markedly improved in the absorption phase compared with the
               LAG model for all drugs. The parameter estimates related to the
               absorption differed between the two models while the estimates
               of the pharmacokinetic disposition parameters were similar.
               CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the TRANSIT model is an
               attractive alternative for modeling drug absorption delay,
               especially when a LAG model poorly describes the drug absorption
               phase or is numerically unstable.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: When utilizing population
               pharmacokinetic (popPK) models for a priori dosage
               individualization, selecting the best model is crucial to obtain
               adequate doses. We developed and evaluated several
               model-selection and ensembling methods, using external
               evaluation on the basis of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)
               samples to identify the best (set of) models per patient for a
               priori dosage individualization. METHODS: PK data and models
               describing both hospitalized patients (n = 134) receiving
               continuous vancomycin (26 models) and patients (n = 92)
               receiving imatinib in an outpatient setting (12 models) are
               included. Target attainment of four model-selection methods was
               compared with standard dosing: the best model based on external
               validation, uninformed model ensembling, model ensembling using
               a weighting scheme on the basis of covariate-stratified external
               evaluation, and model selection using covariates in decision
               trees that were subsequently ensembled. RESULTS: Overall, the
               use of PK models improved the proportion of patients exposed to
               concentrations within the therapeutic window for both cohorts.
               Relative improvement of proportion on target for best model,
               unweighted, weighted, and decision trees were - 7.0\%, 2.3\%,
               11.4\%, and 37.0\% (vancomycin method-development); 23.2\%,
               7.9\%, 15.6\%, and, 77.2\% (vancomycin validation); 40.7\%,
               50.0\%, 59.5\%, and 59.5\% (imatinib method-development); and
               19.0\%, 28.5\%, 38.0\%, and 23.8\% (imatinib validation),
               respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The best (set of) models per patient
               for a priori dosage individualization can be identified using a
               relatively small set of TDM samples as external evaluation.
               Adequately performing popPK models were identified while also
               excluding poor-performing models. Dose recommendations resulted
               in more patients within the therapeutic range for both
               vancomycin and imatinib. Prospective validation is necessary

               parameter (kg/mB), where B is the power that minimises the
               correlation with height.Aim: To investigate how the Benn
               parameter changes across age (10-65 years) and time (1956-2015)
               and differs between sexes.Subjects and methods: The sample
               comprised 49,717 individuals born in 1946, 1958, 1970 or 2001.
               Cross-sectional estimates of the Benn parameter were produced
               and cohort differences at ages 10/11 and 42/43 years were
               examined using linear regression. Multilevel modelling was used
               to develop trajectories showing how the Benn parameter changed
               over age from childhood to mid-adulthood in the three older
               cohorts.Results: The Benn parameter was closest to 2 in
               childhood but consistently lower across adulthood, particularly
               in females and the most recent cohort. At ages 10/11 years, the
               Benn parameter was greater than 3 in both sexes in the 2001
               cohort but between 2.2 and 2.7 in the three older cohorts. This
               difference was estimated to be +0.67 (0.53, 0.81) in males and
               +0.53 (0.38, 0.68) in females, compared to the 1946 cohort, and
               was driven by a much higher weight SD in the 2001 cohort.
               Conversely, at ages 42/43 years, the Benn parameter was lowest
               in the 1970 cohort due to a slightly lower weight-height
               correlation. This difference was estimated to be -0.12 (-0.34,
               0.10) in males and -0.15 (-0.42, 0.13) in females, compared to
               the 1946 cohort.Conclusions: Changes over time in the obesogenic
               environment appear to have firstly reduced the Benn parameter
               due to a lowering of the weight-height correlation but secondly
               and more drastically increased the Benn parameter due to
               increasing weight variation.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Beta-lactam antibiotics ($\beta$LA) are the most
               commonly used antibiotics in the intensive care unit (ICU). ICU
               patients present many pathophysiological features that cause
               pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) specificities,
               leading to the risk of underdosage. The French Society of
               Pharmacology and Therapeutics (SFPT) and the French Society of
               Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine (SFAR) have joined
               forces to provide guidelines on the optimization of beta-lactam
               treatment in ICU patients. METHODS: A consensus committee of 18
               experts from the two societies had the mission of producing
               these guidelines. The entire process was conducted independently
               of any industry funding. A list of questions formulated
               according to the PICO model (Population, Intervention,
               Comparison, and Outcomes) was drawn-up by the experts. Then, two
               bibliographic experts analysed the literature published since
               January 2000 using predefined keywords according to PRISMA
               recommendations. The quality of the data identified from the
               literature was assessed using the GRADE\textregistered{}
               methodology. Due to the lack of powerful studies having used
               mortality as main judgement criteria, it was decided, before
               drafting the recommendations, to formulate only ``optional''
               recommendations. RESULTS: After two rounds of rating and one
               amendment, a strong agreement was reached by the SFPT-SFAR
               guideline panel for 21 optional recommendations and a
               recapitulative algorithm for care covering four areas: (i)
               pharmacokinetic variability, (ii) PK-PD relationship, (iii)
               administration modalities, and (iv) therapeutic drug monitoring
               (TDM). The most important recommendations regarding $\beta$LA
               administration in ICU patients concerned (i) the consideration
               of the many sources of PK variability in this population; (ii)
               the definition of free plasma concentration between four and
               eight times the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the
               causative bacteria for 100\% of the dosing interval as PK-PD
               target to maximize bacteriological and clinical responses; (iii)
               the use of continuous or prolonged administration of $\beta$LA
               in the most severe patients, in case of high MIC bacteria and in
               case of lower respiratory tract infection to improve clinical
               cure; and (iv) the use of TDM to improve PK-PD target
               achievement. CONCLUSIONS: The experts strongly suggest the use
               of personalized dosing, continuous or prolonged infusion and
               therapeutic drug monitoring when administering $\beta$LA in
               critically ill patients.",
